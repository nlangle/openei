==Open Energy Information==
Welcome to OpenEI and the world of open energy information, data and resources.

The information you'll find on OpenEI is community driven, it is a collection of content and data provided by contributors ranging from experts to enthusiasts.  The platform is a wiki, similar to Wikipedia’s Wiki, with which many people are already familiar.  OpenEI users can view, edit, add data – and download data for free.  There are currently more than {{NUMBEROFPAGES}} pages on OpenEI, those pages contain a wide variety of topics: from renewable energy, to policy & regulations, to analyzed data and raw data.

If you're not sure where to begin your information expedition, we recommend you start by exploring some of these featured content categories, or join our user community and [[OpenEI:Get_Involved|get involved]].
